This research develops a machine learning-based predictive model for cardiovascular disease (CVD) management, achieving an 89% accuracy rate. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of clinical and demographic features, the model effectively identifies individuals at high risk. This enables early interventions and personalized treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes. The application of sophisticated algorithms allows for the identification of complex patterns within the data, enhancing predictive performance. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning to significantly advance CVD risk assessment and management.
