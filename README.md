# ðŸ«€ Cardiovascular_Disease_Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease using patient health data. Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset. Conducted exploratory data analysis with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express to uncover trends and correlations. Trained and evaluated models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning. Deployed the best-performing model using Flask and serialized it with Joblib for efficient reuse.
